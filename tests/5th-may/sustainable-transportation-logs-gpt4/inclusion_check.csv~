The information that a city has a name is covered in Statement 1 where it is mentioned that the name of each city needs to be stored. The fact that the city in Statement 2 is sustainable does not contradict Statement 1, it is just additional information not covered in Statement 1.","No, Statement 1 does not encompass all the information provided in Statement 2. While Statement 1 refers to storing names and countries of cities in general, Statement 2 specifically talks about a sustainable city having a name, but makes no mention of the country.

Also, the number of spots is not specified in Statement 2.","From the information given, Statement 2 appears to be an incomplete sentence as it did not specify the number of spots a bike station has. Regardless, it mentions ""spots"" at a bike station, which is part of the information outlined in Statement 1. However, for a complete comparison, Statement 2 needs to provide full details about the bike station's name and the specific number of spots it has.","No, Statement 1 does not incorporate every aspect presented in Statement 2. In Statement 2, it is not explicitly mentioned what attributes of a bike station need to be stored, it only mentions that a bike station has spots. However, Statement 1 explicitly states that we need to store the name of each bike station and the number of spots that it has to park bikes, besides the address.
