You have been asked to create a system to manage the front-desk activities of a hotel. The system will be used to enter reservations as well as to check people in and out of the hotel.

The hotel contains 30 rooms in which guests can stay. Some hotel rooms adjoin others, i.e., there are internal doors between them, so a guest can stay either in an individual room or a suite (multiple rooms). Each hotel room is assigned a quality level (e.g., a larger room or a room with a view would be better than a smaller room without a view). Each room also has a certain number and type of beds, a room number, and a smoking/non-smoking status. Each quality level has a maximum daily rate, although the rate that a guest pays may be less.
When a hotel guest wishes to make a reservation, the hotel clerk asks him or her what nights he or she wants to stay and the type of room he or she wants. The system must verify whether room(s) are available on those nights before allowing a reservation to be made.
The hotel needs to record basic information about each guest, e.g., his/her name, address, telephone number, credit card, etc. A reservation can be cancelled at any time.
When a guest checks in, the room is allocated to him/her until s/he checks out. The system must keep track of the guest's account, and print his or her bill.
