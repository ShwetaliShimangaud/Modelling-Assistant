description = "Cities put in place bike rental systems to encourage their citizens to be more sustainable. For each city, we need to store its name and country. Cities have bike stations located at different addresses. Apart from the address, for each bike station we need to store its name and the number of spots that it has to park bikes. When bikes are not in use, they are parked in bike stations. For each bike, we store its code as an integer and the price per hour. Note that different bikes might have different prices per hour.Bikes are rented by users. For each user we need to keep their id, name and credit card information. For each rental, we need to keep track of the start and end date, the pickup station, the dropoff station, the user who has rented the bike and the bike that has been rented."
