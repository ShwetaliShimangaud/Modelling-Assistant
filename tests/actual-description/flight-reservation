description = "Airlines nowadays have fully computerized flight ticketing and seat reservation systems. The company sells plane tickets for travelling between cities. Each flight between two cities is identified by a flight-number, which is constituted by an airline designator (2 characters) and a 1 to 4 digit number (eastbound and northbound flights are traditionally assigned even numbers, while westbound and southbound flights have odd numbers).While on a trip, a passenger may take several flights. For each flight, the passenger has an assigned seat, which is identified by a row number followed by a letter from the DEC alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K). When booking a flight, the customer has to provide his first, middle and last name, and optionally his citizenship and passport number. He also has to decide whether to book first class, business class, or economy. On planes, the seats are arranged into 3 different sections corresponding to their class.Check-in is typically available 24 hours before the time of departure of the first flight of a trip. When checking in, the passenger has to provide his citizenship and passport number unless he already provided it. Passengers are typically also offered the possibility to upgrade their flight class (e.g., from economy to business) for each flight of the trip. Finally, during check in, a passenger can state how many pieces of luggage he wants to take along for his trip. For security reasons, luggage needs to be traced during a trip, i.e., at any point in time the location of the luggage must be known. Also, airplane regulations state that the luggage of a passenger who does not board a plane has to be taken off the plane before departure."
