description = "Strategic Conquest is a turn-based multi-player military strategy game that involves conquering your opponents cities before they conquer you — the ultimate goal being world domination. The game is fought on land, sea and in the air, with different types of military units (e.g., tank, fighter air planes, etc.) produced by cities that are under control of each player. Each day, each player gets to move his units, attack enemy units, and control the production of his cities. If a player looses all his cities, they are eliminated from the game. The player who eliminates all other opponents wins the game.At the very beginning of the game, each player is given a city, but has no military force. Cities under a player’s control are the only means from which he / she can produce offensive and defensive military units. To obtain and maintain the biggest military force in the world, one must control the most cities. Cities are strewn throughout the world; their number and location in the world are fixed from the beginning and do not change with the unrolling of the game. They are, so to speak, part of the geography of the world (map).The state of a city, however, can change; it is either empty, or controlled by a player. In order to conquer a city, the city must be free of enemy units, i.e., all enemy units fortified in the city must be destroyed first. Then the city can be conquered by moving a military land unit onto it; note that the conquering unit is destroyed in the capturing process, even if the city did not belong to any player in the first place.Once a city has been captured, it is put to work to produce military units. Forces are produced and mobilized each day, one at a time. Each military unit takes a predefined number of days to produce. The type of the unit to be produced in a city is chosen by the controlling player. Every city is capable of producing land and air-based units. Only port cities, however, have the capability of producing sea- based military units. A port city is a city that is located on the shore, i.e. at least one of the 8 adjacent sectors on the map is a sea sector.Each military unit either travels over land, by sea, or in the air. Air-based military units can go anywhere, i.e. over land and sea, land-based units are bound to the land, and sea-based military units are bound to the sea. The only exception to this rule is port cities, which are capable of hosting all three kinds, i.e. air- , sea-, and land-based military units.Each unit has a certain capacity in terms of its strength, speed, fuel, etc., which can be reduced via flights, in the case of fuel, and battles, in the case of strength. Every step of movement of an air unit consumes one fuel unit. Passing a turn also consumes one unit. The fuel of a military unit can be replenished by passing over an allied occupied city, or by passing over a carrier. If an air unit runs out of fuel, it crashes and is destroyed. Repair work can also be done at a city, at the rate of 1 strength point per day, immobilizing the unit for that day. A city under attack (i.e. any unit fortified in the city is attacked) can not perform repairs.With the rise of the new day, each military unit of an allied force, in turn, must either: move, make an attack, shell the enemy (if equipped), or stay where it is (pass).Some units have other special abilities. See the following table for more detail on each military unit.• Strength — number of strength points a unit has. Once a unit has zero strength points it is destroyed.• Speed — maximum number of sectors a unit can travel in a day.• Cost — number of days that a city takes to produce the unit.• Movement — allowed zone of movement: land, sea or air.• Radar Range — number of sectors in all directions that the unit can detect enemy units or see the state of a city.• Shelling capability.• Fuel (only applicable to air units) — number of sectors that can be traveled before refueling is required.Tank: Strength: 2, Speed: 2, Cost: 4, Movement: Land, Radar Range: 2.Artillery: Strength: 2, Speed: 1, Cost: 4, Movement: Land, Radar Range: 3, Shelling capability Fighter: Strength: 2, Speed: 20, Cost: 6, Movement: Air, Radar Range: 2, Fuel: 20.Bombers: Strength: 3, Speed: 8, Cost: 20, Movement: Air, Radar Range: 3, Fuel: 20.A bomber plane has a bomb attack that can be used on cities. A bomb attack kills all enemy units fortified in a city, as well as any enemy and allied units on adjacent sectors.Transport: Strength: 4, Speed: 3, Cost: 8, Movement: Sea, Radar Range: 1.A transport can carry up to 6 ground units from one island to the other. To load units, move them onto the transport. While the units are on board, they can not move nor attack. Units can be unloaded at any time onto an adjacent shore sector.Battleship: Strength: 18, Speed: 4, Cost: 20, Movement: Sea, Radar Range: 3, Shelling capability.Carrier: Strength: 8, Speed: 2, Cost: 10, Movement: Sea, Radar Range: 5 Air units that pass over a carrier are refueled."
